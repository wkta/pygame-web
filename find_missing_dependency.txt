To run the demo...

First, go fetch a very old version of the game engine, here:

https://github.com/pyved-solution/pyved-engine/releases/tag/v0.0.6-alpha

the missing file:
https://gist.github.com/wkta/ee1f80231258bf73e97167a22ab986b9

You'll need to copy-paste the BaseGame class into your engine.py to patch it manually
